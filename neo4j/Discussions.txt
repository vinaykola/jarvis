Minutes of the meeting 

1. Search with random character display - Initial graph has the node with the maximum centrality/random node - d3/Viva
1.1 Single click on one node displays a picture (got from wikia, random picture of a guy/girl based on gender if pic doesnt exist), and gives an option on the top - Recommendations
1.1.1 Clicking recommendations goes to a different page which has  the recommended storylines (from wikia or a subset of the comic book series in which both appear in)
1.2 Double click makes that the center of your graph so that you can zoom in and see characters related to it, for exploration

2, you can search for characters in the search box and filter the graph based on the search - At no point we show the entire huge graph, just a subset for a random character.

For recommendations we use LSA to represent the feature, and use KNN with the cosine similarity or euclidean distance as the distance measure. 

We precompute the similarity score between each character before the graph is generated, and we use that for recommended storylines calculation as well as one of the feature. 
PROBLEM that we need to figure out is with how many comic book series/characters should we compare the similarity with to get the list of recommendations. DOing it across the set of the
